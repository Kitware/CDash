  # This Helm chart uses an embedded postgres database by default.
  # To use an external database instead, set postgresql.enabled: false
  # below and create a secret named '<release name>-db' with the following
  # values:
  # - host (required)
  # - password (required)
  # - username (optional, defaults to 'postgres')
  # - database (optional, defaults to 'cdash')

  # By default, this Helm chart uses an embedded MinIO for object storage.
  # To use AWS S3 instead, set minio.enabled: false below and create a secret
  # named '<release name>-s3' with the following values:
  # - accesskey
  # - secretkey
  # - region
  # - bucket

  # To securely store other other sensitive configuration data
  # (e.g. OAuth/email credentials) create a secret and name it here.
  # The keys of this secret need to match the names of the environment
  # variables that CDash expects.
