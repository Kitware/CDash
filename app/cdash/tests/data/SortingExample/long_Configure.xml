<Log>CMake Warning: CMake is forcing CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to "/usr/bin/c++" to match that imported from VTK.  This is required because C++ projects must use the same compiler.  If this message appears for more than one imported project, you have conflicting C++ compilers and will have to re-build one of those projects. Was set to /usr/bin/g++-4.0
Fltk resources not found, GUI application will not respond to mouse events
