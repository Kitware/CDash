    /**
     * Given NotificationPreferences TopicFactory::createFrom will return an array of decorated
     * topics.
     *
     * Topics come in two flavors--regular topics and decorate-able topics. What follows is a
     * discussion of the distinction.
     *
     * Decorate-able topics can be thought of as fundamental topics, e.g. DynamicAnalysisTopic,
     * BuildErrorTopic, or TestFailureTopic and they represent the type of build (that is, a phase
     * in the build process such as the dynamic analysis, the actual build itself or testing)
     * represented by the xml submitted to CDash by CTest. If a user wants to receive a notification
     * about a test failure the return of this method will include a TestFailureTopic.
     *
     * Note that a TestFailureTopic is decorate-able. Consider the other preferences that may be
     * present in addition to the test failure:
     *   * A user may want to receive notification of test failures only once.
     *   * A user may want to receive notifications of test failures only if user is the author of a
     *     change that prompted the failure.
     *   * A user may not want to receive multiple notifications of test failure, yet receive a
     *     notification when the test has been fixed.
     *
     * At any given time, it's possible for any combination of these preferences to co-exist, thus the
     * reason for the distinction between regular and decorate-able topics. For instance given the
     * following scenario:
     *
     *   * A user is subscribed to DynamicAnalysis submissions
     *   * The user only wishes to see those DynamicAnalysis submissions from the Nightly submissions
     *   * The user wishes to see all DynamicAnalysis submissions regardless of authorship
     *
     * Included in the return from this method will be a DynamicAnalysisTopic decorated by a
     * GroupMemberShipTopic.
     *
     * In another scenario:
     *
     *   * A user is subscribed to test phase submissions with failures
     *   * User only wishes to see failures authored by his or herself
     *   * User does not wish to receive further notifications after the original
     *   * User does wish to receive a notification authored failure was fixed
     *
     * Included in the return from this method will be a TestFailureTopic decorated with an Authored-
     * Topic, an EmailSentTopic, FixedTopic.
