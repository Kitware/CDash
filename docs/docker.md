## Quick Start (testing installation) ##

The following instructions spin up CDash for local experimentation.

1. If you haven't done so already, begin by cloning the CDash repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kitware/CDash
cd CDash
```

2. Next, use docker compose to spin up your new CDash instance:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
               -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml \
               -f docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml \
               --env-file .env.dev up -d
```

3. Browse to http://localhost:8080.  You should see a freshly installed copy of CDash with the latest database schema.


### Manually adding users
If you choose not to use an external OAuth2 or SAML authentication provider with CDash, you may want to create users
manually.  Use the following command to create a user from the command line:
```bash
docker exec --user www-data cdash bash -c "php artisan user:save --email=<email> --password=<password> --firstname=<first name> --lastname=<last name> --institution=<institution> --admin=<1/0>"
```

Once a user with administrative privileges has been created, you can use that user to create other users via the web interface.

### Running the test suite
```bash
docker exec -it cdash /bin/bash
cd _build
ctest
```

## Configuration

### Why so many YAML files?
You may have noticed that CDash's `docker compose` configuration is [split across multiple files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/). The allows us to support various workflows (production vs. development, local vs MinIO storaage, etc) while minimizing code duplication.

For example, to use MinIO instead of local storage, pass `-f docker/docker-compose.minio.yml` to the `docker compose` commands mentioned in this document.

### Building from source
If you would prefer to build your own Docker images for CDash, pass the `--build` option to your `docker compose up` command.


## Production Installation

A production installation differs from a testing installation in the following ways:
* Traffic is served over https. For this reason, these instructions assume you don't already have a web server on your host system that's serving traffic on port 443.
* CDash will be serving traffic over an externally-visible URL (not `localhost`).
* CDash's submissions will be parsed _asychronously_. Note that the `cdash_worker` service will emit errors until the database tables are created.

To set up a CDash production instance using docker compose, follow these steps:
* Generate or obtain SSL certificate files. Some possibilities here are [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or [self-signed certificates](https://wiki.debian.org/Self-Signed_Certificate). Make sure the resulting files will be readable to the `www-data` user (UID 33) in the CDash container.
* `cp .env.example .env`
* Edit `.env` and modify the following lines:
  - `APP_URL=https://<my-cdash-url>`
  - `SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE=</path/to/certs/cdash.pem>`
  - `SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE=</path/to/certs/cdash.key>`
  - `DB_PASSWORD=<your desired database password>`
  - `NUM_WORKERS=<desired number of queue worker replicas, defaults to 1>`
  - `WORKER_MEMORY_LIMIT`: restart worker after parsing a job if it consumed more than this amount of memory (in MB). Default: 256.
* Run this command to start your CDash containers:
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env \
	   -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
	   -f docker/docker-compose.production.yml \
	   -f docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml \
	    up -d
```


## Pull in changes from upstream CDash (upgrade)

If you're using prebuilt images from DockerHub, run the following command to download the latest image:

```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
               -f docker/docker-compose.production.yml \
               -f docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml \
               pull cdash
```

and then repeat your `docker compose up` command to start your CDash containers.

If you prefer to build your own images locally, you can pass the `--build` option to your `docker compose up` command as shown previously in this document.

## Cleaning up
CDash's docker compose system creates volumes for persistent data. A primary benefit of this setup is that you won't lose the contents of your database if that container stops running.

If you're done experimenting with CDash locally and you would like to remove these volumes, perform the following commands:
```bash
docker volume ls                      # shows what volumes are defined on your system
docker volume rm cdash_storage        # CDash's local storage for submission files
docker volume rm cdash_postgresqldata # for postgres
```
